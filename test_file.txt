What is the main function of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model?

    A RAG model combines a retriever and a generator to enhance the output by fetching relevant information from a given dataset before generating a response.

How does the retriever in a RAG model work?

    The retriever component in a RAG model queries a dataset or knowledge base to find relevant information based on the input query, which is then passed to the generator.

What types of applications are ideal for using RAG models?

    RAG models are ideal for applications requiring deep knowledge and context, such as question answering systems, content creation tools, and any AI that needs to provide informed and accurate responses.

Can RAG models be used in real-time applications?

    Yes, RAG models can be used in real-time applications, although their efficiency and speed depend on the complexity of the retrieval database and the processing power available.
